This is a simple approach to perform Deep Learning Algorithms from Scratch. I have used only NumPy for model creation and matplotlib for visualisation.

## What can this do?
* Create a simple Sequential model of Feed Forward Neural Networks, Convolution, Dropout, MaxPool, Flatten etc.
* Has Optimizers like SGD, Momentum, ADAM, RMS Prop etc.

## Try it!
Just download files under this folder and run `test.py`.
